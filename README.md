Taken in SP22 :)

## Mapping Population and Place Visit Changes of Chinese Ethnic Enclaves within New York City
The two spatial questions I ask are:
  1. Can the supposed decline of Chinatown, Manhattan and growth of Sunset Park, Brooklyn and
     Flushing, Queens be temporally contextualized through race and rent/income maps?
  2. Did place visits in NYC Chinese ethnic enclaves decrease at a greater rate with respect to their home
     boroughs during the years 2019-2021?

The significance of these questions is that they ensure that these ethnic communities are seen if there is patterns
of inflow/outflow, applications to housing policy in seeing the long-term effects and population shifts as a result
of rising rent and gentrification, a focus on cultural preservation, and identification of extra aid to businesses and
other places needed in the case of disproportionate impacts due to Covid-19.
